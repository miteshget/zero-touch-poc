== 1.6 Handlers

Handlers are used for tasks that should only run when notified by another task. Typically, they are used to restart services after a configuration change.

Let's say we want to ensure the firewall is configured correctly on all web servers and then reload the firewall service to apply any new settings. We'll define a handler that reloads the firewall service and is notified by a task that ensures the desired firewall rules are in place:


== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Extend the `system_setup.yml` playbook to add the firewall tasks

[NOTE]
====
In the *VSCode Editor* tab
====

* Open the *Editor* tab, and edit the `system_setup.yml` playbook. Make sure you add the new tasks below related to the firewall. Remember to check the indentation!
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: Basic System Setup
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    user_name: 'padawan'
    package_name: httpd
    apache_service_name: httpd
  tasks:
    - name: Install security updates for the kernel
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: 'kernel'
        state: latest
        security: true
        update_only: true
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Create a new user
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ user_name }}"
        state: present
        create_home: true

    - name: Install Apache on web servers
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Ensure Apache is running and enabled
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: "{{ apache_service_name }}"
        state: started
        enabled: true
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Install firewalld
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: firewalld
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Ensure firewalld is running
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: firewalld
        state: started
        enabled: true
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']

    - name: Allow HTTP traffic on web servers
      ansible.posix.firewalld:
        service: http
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']
      notify: Reload Firewall

  handlers:
    - name: Reload Firewall
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: firewalld
        state: reloaded
----

* Understanding the playbook:
+
** The `notify` section calls the handler only if the "Allow HTTP traffic on web servers" task makes any changes in one of the hosts. That way the service is only reloaded if needed - and not each time the playbook is run.
** The `handlers` section defines a task that is only run on notification. And the `name` field is used to call it from a task.

+
[WARNING]
====
Notice how the `name` of the `handlers` is used within the `notify` section of the "Allow HTTP traffic on web servers" configuration task. This ensures that the proper handler is executed as there can be multiple handlers within an Ansible playbook.
====

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Run the `system_setup.yml` playbook

[NOTE]
====
In the **Control** tab
====

* Change directory to `ansible-files` and run the playbook:
+
[source,cmd]
----
cd ansible-files
----

+
[source,cmd]
----
ansible-navigator run system_setup.yml
----


== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Run the `system_setup.yml` playbook again to test the handler

[NOTE]
====
In the **Control** tab
====

* Run the playbook again.
+
[source,cmd]
----
ansible-navigator run system_setup.yml
----


* Notice anything with the output?
+
Nothing was changed, thus the playbook ran and you will notice the PLAY RECAP does not show any `changed` lines. The firewall was not restarted as there were no changes.

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 4 - Verify Apache listening on port 80


[NOTE]
====
Check the new **Node1 Web** tab at the top, next to the **Control** tab.
====

* You should see the following webpage after the playbook has run (give it a few seconds or click the small arrow inside the tab next to the **Node1 Web** title if you are seeing another message):
+
image::image.png[]

+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can check in the CLI using the **Control** tab.
====

* For the CLI check, as the output would be too long, we are using `grep` to get just a few lines:
+
[source,cmd]
----
curl http://node1 | grep "HTTP Server"
----
+
.output
[source,textinfo]
----
rust
----

* Now let's try with `node3`, the server in the `[database]` group:
+
[source,cmd]
----
curl http://node3 
----
+
.output
[source,textinfo]
----
kotlin
----

* The output should look like this:
+
[source,textinfo]
----
curl: (7) Failed to connect to node3 port 80: Connection refused
----
