= 1.3 - From 1 to many

The biggest strength of automation lies in its ability to manage multiple systems simultaneously. In this challenge, you will modify your Ansible Playbook to target not just one host (`node1`), but to modify a group of hosts (`web`) and run the playbook on all hosts within that group.

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Modify hosts in the playbook


[NOTE]
====
In the *VSCode Editor* tab
====

* Open your `system_setup.yml` playbook and modify the `hosts:` line value from the individual `node1` to the `web` group. Look at the example below:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Basic System Setup
  hosts: web
  become: true
----


== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Run the system_setup.yml playbook again

[NOTE]
====
Switch to the *Control* top tab.
====

* Go into the playbook directory:
+
[source,cmd]
----
cd ansible-files
----

* And run the Ansible playbook again with `ansible-navigator`
+
[source,cmd]
----
ansible-navigator run system_setup.yml
----
+
[WARNING]
====
The playbook task may take a minute or two to complete as it is populating the repository metadata and updating packages for the `node2`.
====

== ‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Verify myuser exists in both nodes

* Once the Ansible Playbook successfully completes, run the following steps to check manually `myuser` exists in both servers.
+
*For node1:*
+
[source,cmd]
----
ssh node1 id myuser
----

+
*For node2:*
+
[source,cmd]
----
ssh node2 id myuser
----

* Output should be similar to the following:
+
[source,text]
----
uid=1008(myuser) gid=1009(myuser) groups=1009(myuser)
----
